                > Dynamic Real-time Interactive Vehicle Environment - Honda (USA)
            </h3>
            <div class="project-description">

                <p><br>Graduate Research Assistantship at Georgia Tech with the <i>Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory</i> – Sponsored project for Honda (USA)</p>
                    <p>Mechanical Simulation Engineer</p>

                <h4><br>Project Summary</h4>
                <p>Developed real-time driver-in-the-loop vehicle simulation models using <i>SIMPACK by Dassault Systèmes</i>. Modulated system model fidelity of multi-body dynamics components and proposed alternatives to balance performance and cost.</p>

                <h4><br>Why the Automotive Industry Needs Real-Time (RT) Simulation</h4>
                <p>The automotive industry depends on a diverse range of tests to develop production-ready vehicles that meet <b>high standards of safety, performance, comfort, durability, and regulatory compliance</b>. Both <b>objective</b> and <b>subjective</b> metrics are essential when evaluating a vehicle’s performance, comfort, and usability. Simulations, particularly those incorporating <b>driver-in-the-loop</b> technology, enable the collection of subjective metrics through real-time (RT) simulation. This becomes possible only if the simulation is sufficiently realistic.</p>

                <h4><br>What is Real-Time Simulation?</h4>

                <p>Real-time simulation refers to computer models that operate at the same rate as the physical system they are representing. This allows for dynamic, real-time interactions with the model, making it possible to simulate complex systems in realistic environments.</p>
                <p>Real-time simulation can demand significant computational resources.</p>

                </p>
                <h4><br>Objective:</h4>
                <p>Honda provided us with a high-fidelity car model developed in Simpack.</p>
                <p>The objective is to streamline the process of creating and refining the fidelity of component models for RT simulation. Specifically, we aim to propose a method for evaluating the <b>trade-off between real-time computational performance and model error</b> in multi-body dynamics (MBD) for RT driver-in-the-loop simulations.</p>
        
                <h4><br>Technical Tasks:</h4>
                <ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Configure the baseline model on Simpack based on Honda's car model provided.</li>
                        <li>Configure the solver settings.</li>
                        <li>Analyze simulation bottlenecks to identify opportunities for simplifying the baseline model's components.</li>
                        <li>Generation of all alternative simulations with varying levels of fidelity using statistical techniques such as Design of Experiments (DOE).</li>
                        <li>Run simulations using Simpack.</li>
                        <li>Determine the real-time factor (computational cost) and quantify the error for each simulation.</li>
                        <li>Rank the alternatives by evaluating the trade-off between computational cost and performance.</li>
                    </ul>

                </ul>


                <h4>Model Simplification</h4>
                <p>The key components of focus include suspensions, subframe, tires, and steering.</p>
                <p>Each <strong>alternative</strong> represents a variation of our car model, where different components have specific fidelity levels that vary across simulations.</p>
                
                <p>Example of component simplification: </p>

                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/ex_comp_simp.jpg" alt="Example of component simplification" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">
                </div>

                <p>Additionally, we will employ <strong>Design of Experiments (DoE)</strong> to systematically analyze how different factors affect the outcome. DoE will help us plan, conduct, and interpret controlled tests to evaluate the relationships between process factors and model outputs.</p>
        
                <h4><br>Main Tools and Enablers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>JMP:</strong> Used for generating DoE and creating surrogate models to predict performance across different alternatives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simpack:</strong> Used to model mechanical components and simulate their behavior in various conditions.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4><br>Error Quantification of the simulations and Challenges:</h4>

                <p>Error quantification involves measuring the difference between a simplified model and the high-fidelity car model, focusing particularly on chassis speeds and accelerations. Even small discrepancies can lead to significant objective and subjective differences perceptible to the driver.</p>

                <p>Key challenges include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Point-to-point alignment of dynamic time serie between the baseline's outputs and the simulations' outputs.</li>
                    <li>Complex interactions between components in the multi-body system.</li>
                    <li>Handling multivariate problems.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p><strong>Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)</strong> will be employed to address these challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It can handle temporal misalignments effectively.</li>
                    <li>It is robust to speed variations and captures similarities between different nonlinearities.</li>
                    <li>It doesn’t require uniform sampling, making it adaptable to real-world data.</li>
                    <li>DTW allows for intuitive visualizations that can aid in understanding the discrepancies between the models and real-world measurements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><br>Key Methodologies</h4>
            
                <h5>1. Point Detection</h5>
                <p>Identified the 2D positions of metallic markers in X-ray images using two main approaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OpenCV-Based Detection:</strong> Utilized <code>SimpleBlobDetector()</code> after pre-processing the images with adaptive thresholding to enhance the visibility of the markers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Image Correlation:</strong> Compared regions of the image with a sample marker template to find matches without requiring binary image conversion. Achieved 95% accuracy in detecting markers.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>            

                <h5>3. Temporal Tracking</h5>
                <p>Tracked marker movement between consecutive time steps with two approaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OpenCV Object Tracking:</strong> Initial attempts using OpenCV’s built-in methods (e.g., brute force) were unreliable due to shape deformation in binary images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Algorithm:</strong> Developed an algorithm assuming planar motion (e.g., in X-Z plane) to match points based on proximity in consecutive time frames. Achieved nearly 100% accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div style="text-align: center;">

                </div>    
            
                <h5>4. Data Clustering and Visualization</h5>
                <p>Clustered 3D points to group markers by vertebrae. Challenges such as overlapping markers were addressed through a combination of DBSCAN and manual correction options in the interface.</p>
            
                <div style="text-align: center;">

                <h5>5. User Interface</h5>
                <p>Designed a Tkinter-based interface allowing users to visualize results, adjust detection thresholds, and manually correct errors. This ensured the tool was user-friendly and adaptable for various image sets.</p>
            
                <h4><br>Error Rates and Observations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Image Correlation: 21% error</li>
                    <li>Improved Correlation: 17% error</li>

                </div>

                <p>A mechanical watch works through a complex series of interactions between its key components. The main power source is the <strong>mainspring</strong>, which stores energy when wound. This energy is transferred through the <strong>gear train</strong>, which regulates the movement of the watch hands. The <strong>escapement</strong> controls the release of energy, ensuring a consistent flow to the <strong>balance wheel</strong>, which oscillates back and forth, regulating the watch's timekeeping. The <strong>crown</strong> is used to wind the mainspring and set the time. Together, these components work in harmony, allowing the watch to keep accurate time without the need for batteries.</p>
