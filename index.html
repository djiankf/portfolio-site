                > Dynamic Real-time Interactive Vehicle Environment - Honda (USA)
            </h3>
            <div class="project-description">

                <p><br>Graduate Research Assistantship at Georgia Tech with the <i>Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory</i> – Sponsored project for Honda (USA)</p>
                    <p>Mechanical Simulation Engineer</p>

                <h4><br>Project Summary</h4>
                <p>Developed real-time driver-in-the-loop vehicle simulation models using <i>SIMPACK by Dassault Systèmes</i>. Modulated system model fidelity of multi-body dynamics components and proposed alternatives to balance performance and cost.</p>

                <h4><br>Why the Automotive Industry Needs Real-Time (RT) Simulation</h4>
                <p>The automotive industry depends on a diverse range of tests to develop production-ready vehicles that meet <b>high standards of safety, performance, comfort, durability, and regulatory compliance</b>. Both <b>objective</b> and <b>subjective</b> metrics are essential when evaluating a vehicle’s performance, comfort, and usability. Simulations, particularly those incorporating <b>driver-in-the-loop</b> technology, enable the collection of subjective metrics through real-time (RT) simulation. This becomes possible only if the simulation is sufficiently realistic.</p>

                <h4><br>What is Real-Time Simulation?</h4>

                <p>Real-time simulation refers to computer models that operate at the same rate as the physical system they are representing. This allows for dynamic, real-time interactions with the model, making it possible to simulate complex systems in realistic environments.</p>

                </p>
                <h4><br>Our Objective:</h4>
                <p>Streamline the process of creating and refining the fidelity of component models for RT simulation. Specifically, we aim to propose a method for evaluating the <b>trade-off between real-time computational performance and model error</b> in multi-body dynamics (MBD) for RT driver-in-the-loop simulations.</p>
        
                <h4><br>Technical Tasks:</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Conduct a literature review to understand the relevant concepts.</li>

                            <li>Conduct simulations and experimentation to identify optimal solver settings.</li>
                            <li>Validate and verify the models to ensure accuracy and reliability.</li>
                            <li>Automate parts of the modeling process to improve efficiency.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Approach Evaluation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Evaluate the real-time factor of the simulation models.</li>
                            <li>Assess model error by comparing simulation results to real-world data.</li>

                    </li>
   
                </ul>
        
                <h4><br>Morphological Matrix:</h4>
                <p>To explore various model configurations, we will evaluate different combinations of fidelity levels for key vehicle components (e.g., suspension, steering, subframe, tires). By creating alternatives that mix different fidelity levels (e.g., suspension with fidelity level 3, steering with fidelity level 1), we can examine how each combination affects real-time performance, computational cost, and model precision.</p>
                <p>Additionally, we will employ <strong>Design of Experiments (DoE)</strong> to systematically analyze how different factors affect the outcome. DoE will help us plan, conduct, and interpret controlled tests to evaluate the relationships between process factors and model outputs.</p>
        
                <h4><br>Main Tools and Enablers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>JMP:</strong> Used for generating DoE and creating surrogate models to predict performance across different alternatives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simpack:</strong> Used to model mechanical components and simulate their behavior in various conditions.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4><br>Error Quantification and Challenges:</h4>
                <p>Key challenges include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Point-to-point alignment of dynamic time series.</li>

                > Analysis Program for Spine Kinematics - Research Project
            </h3>
            <div class="project-description">
            
                <p><br>Collaborative project aimed at developing a program to analyze the kinematics of a human spine by tracking vertebrae in 3D from X-ray images. The project involved a team of four researchers and two academic advisors.</p>
                <p>Role: Lead for Point Detection and Temporal Tracking</p>
            
                <h4><br>Project Summary</h4>
                <p>Developed an analysis tool to track and render the movement of human vertebrae over time using X-ray images taken at various angles. The workflow included 2D point detection, point matching between views, 3D point reconstruction, clustering for vertebrae identification, and user interface development for manual intervention and result refinement.</p>
            
                <h4><br>Objective</h4>
                <p>To create a program capable of detecting and tracking metallic markers inserted in vertebrae, reconstructing their 3D positions over time, and providing an intuitive user interface for result review and manual corrections.</p>
            
                <h4><br>Key Methodologies</h4>
            
                <h5>1. Point Detection</h5>
                <p>Identified the 2D positions of metallic markers in X-ray images using two main approaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OpenCV-Based Detection:</strong> Utilized <code>SimpleBlobDetector()</code> after pre-processing the images with adaptive thresholding to enhance the visibility of the markers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Image Correlation:</strong> Compared regions of the image with a sample marker template to find matches without requiring binary image conversion. Achieved XX% accuracy in detecting markers.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>2. Point Matching</h5>
                <p>Matched detected markers between two views taken at the same time step using clustering and DBSCAN methods, achieving near-perfect accuracy. Challenges included occlusions, which were addressed through clustering and point validation techniques.</p>
            
                <h5>3. Temporal Tracking</h5>
                <p>Tracked marker movement between consecutive time steps with two approaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OpenCV Object Tracking:</strong> Initial attempts using OpenCV’s built-in methods (e.g., brute force) were unreliable due to shape deformation in binary images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Algorithm:</strong> Developed an algorithm assuming planar motion (e.g., in X-Z plane) to match points based on proximity in consecutive time frames. Achieved nearly 100% accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>4. Data Clustering and Visualization</h5>
                <p>Clustered 3D points to group markers by vertebrae. Challenges such as overlapping markers were addressed through a combination of DBSCAN and manual correction options in the interface.</p>
            
                <h5>5. User Interface</h5>
                <p>Designed a Tkinter-based interface allowing users to visualize results, adjust detection thresholds, and manually correct errors. This ensured the tool was user-friendly and adaptable for various image sets.</p>
            
                <h4><br>Error Rates and Observations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Image Correlation: 21% error</li>
                    <li>Improved Correlation: 17% error</li>
                    <li>Thresholding: 20% error</li>
                    <li>Point Matching: 2% error</li>
                    <li>Clustering: 5% error</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The tool significantly reduced manual processing time while requiring minimal human intervention for final adjustments.</p>
